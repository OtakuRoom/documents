Gold is a virtual currency established by OtakuRoom to motivate users to stay online and share distributed network data. You can get gold coins by staying online and improving your network type, and use gold coins to browse and download resources in the creative workshop. The gold coin system is intended to improve the distributed network environment of the software and increase user loyalty and satisfaction.

#### **How to get gold coins**
You can get gold coins by staying online. According to the weekly online time, it is divided into 3 different stages, and you can get up to 4320 gold coins every week.
1) Stage 1: Get **2.0** gold coins per minute. In this stage, you can get a maximum of **1440** gold coins per week. After stage 1 ends, you will enter stage 2.
2) Stage 2: Get **1.0** gold coins per minute. In this stage, you can get a maximum of **1440** gold coins per week. After stage 2 ends, you will enter stage 3.
3) Stage 3: Get **0.5** gold coins per minute, and get a maximum of **1440** gold coins per week in this stage. Stop earning coins after phase 3 ends.

#### **How to unlock maximum available stages**
In addition to online time, the user's network type will also affect the sharing stability of distributed network data. Therefore, the gold coin system also unlocks available gold coin acquisition stages according to your network type:
1) Stage 1: **Symmetric NAT** and above are available, this network type **cannot** perform distributed data sharing.
2) Phase 2: **Private network** and above are available, this network type can **limited** support distributed data sharing.
3) Stage 3: **Public network** is available, and this network type can **stable** support distributed data sharing.
> Private network refers to NAT networks other than symmetric, including full cone NAT, restricted cone NAT, and port restricted cone NAT.

#### **How to improve the NAT type**
Usually, the NAT type is the attribute of your current network operator, and we cannot guide you to make private changes. It is recommended to contact your network operator to inquire about how to change the settings. Here are just some references and suggestions:
* Upgrading from symmetric NAT to a private network requires correct configuration of router forwarding rules, which can be done automatically by turning on the UPnP function. If the home router cannot be modified or the external router is restricted to symmetric NAT, such as in some corporate or school network environments, then the NAT type cannot be upgraded.
* Upgrading from a private network to a public network requires the network operator to provide a public ipv4 address, or to support ipv6. Users should contact the operator to obtain it.
* The NAT type will also affect the use of other P2P software, such as BitTorrent and eMule. If the network operator cannot provide a NAT type above symmetric NAT, consider changing the operator.
